# User-Interface-for-Online-Hotel-Booking
Final year B.E HMI Mini Project. This project demonstrates a minimalistic, user friendly and easy to access website for Hotel Booking, which is an online Hotel booking website.  People go to So many Unknown places and they want someone who tell them about local good food and hotels, which often makes them think, can we make it at home? Which place is best for a beautiful view yet in budget.  At Hotel Booking System, people will be able to find all nearby hotels for with best foods and amenities with a healthy twist and they will find restaurant reviews with key quality aspects of restaurants in order to better understand which ones are better.
